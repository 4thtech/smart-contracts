Welcome to the 4thTech OCC (i.e. on-chain communication) Protocol v.1 repository! 👋

This repository is Level-1 integrator access only. It hosts the smart contracts for the 4thTech OCC Protocol v.1 across multiple blockchains. Our goal is to deliver blockchain-agnostic solutions, and this repository is structured to provide clear organization and separation for different blockchain platforms.

Currently, our main development is focused on Ethereum. The `evm` directory in this repository is a Git submodule, containing all the Ethereum-specific smart contracts. This structure allows us to maintain Ethereum contracts independently, and update them as needed.

As we expand our support to other blockchain platforms, new directories for those blockchains will be added to this repository. Each will have its own structure and version control, allowing for clear separation and organization of our contracts across different blockchains.
